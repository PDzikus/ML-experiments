# ML-experiments
My Machine Learning Experiments. I work with Jupyter Notebook, but all notebooks are saved as .HTML and .py file for easier code comparison between versions. 
<br>
### Centroids
k-means with rough sets on "iris" dataset, this is my own implementation of the algorythm - it's not based on any library apart from numpy and pandas
<br>
### MNIST
mnist dataset with Keras and Tensorflow, both with regular Dense network and Convolutional Net
<br>
### IMDB
IMDB dataset from Keras, used for sentiment binary classification. Various experiments with model size
<br>
### Reuters
Reuters articles dataset from Keras, multiclass multilabel classification
<br>
### House pricing
House pricing dataset from Keras, implementation of regression with neural network
<br>
### Titanic
My take on Titanic introductory Kaggle competition with Deep Learning: my best was 78.947% accuracy on test data set. Various experiments.
<br>
### Cats and Dogs
Deep Learning for Vision Recognition. Image classification based on Cats/Dogs dataset from Kaggle
